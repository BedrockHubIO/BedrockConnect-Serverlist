# About (outdated)

Welcome to the official server list for [BedrockConnect](https://bedrockconnect.app), your gateway to a world of diverse servers supported by our special server packs. These packs, primarily collected by our bot from various servers, ensure that the gaming experience for console players is exceptionally cool with their own resource packs on servers. [Additionally, we offer a unified, self-developed global pack](https://github.com/BedrockHubIO/BedrockConnect-Serverlist#introduction-to-bedrockconnect-easily-add-your-server).


**About the App**: Our [tutorial video](https://youtu.be/WVHxB6xfX4s) offers you a quick overview of the BedrockConnect app and its features.
