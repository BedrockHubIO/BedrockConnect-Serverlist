# About


Welcome to the official server list for the [BedrockConnect app](https://bedrockconnect.bedrockhub.io), which features all servers that we support with server packs. These packs enable console players to use custom texture packs. Our automated system downloads server packs and keeps them up-to-date. However, there are some downsides to this approach. Certain servers participate in [our global BedrockConnect serverpack](https://pack.bedrockhub.io/bedrockconnect), which provides a unified pack not just for us, but for all players automatically. These servers are labeled as "Global BedrockConnect Serverpack" on the list.

If you're looking for a quick tutorial, [click here](https://youtu.be/WVHxB6xfX4s).

The good news is that anyone can add their server to the list themselves! Instructions can be found under "What is the easiest way to add my server to the list?"

# What is the easiest way to add my server to the list?

To simplify the process, we've created a [<strong>Serverpack.zip</strong>](https://pack.bedrockhub.io/bedrockconnect) file that you can manage on your server. Here are the benefits of using it:

- Every server has the same server pack, which eliminates the need for constant and annoying pack updates.
- Console players have an enhanced gaming experience with custom texture packs.
- It's effortless to manage, and the pack doesn't hog memory or negatively impact devices.
- There are no disadvantages!

Adding a texture pack to your server is straightforward. Here's how:

**Step 1.** Download the [<strong>Serverpack.zip</strong>](https://pack.bedrockhub.io/bedrockconnect) file.

**Step 2.** Depending on your server software, follow the relevant instructions:

#### [PocketMine](https://discord.com/invite/xxp7VAYQtn): 
- [Documentation](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP/blob/stable/resources/resource_packs.yml) 

#### [Nukkit](https://discord.com/invite/5PzMkyK):
- Simply move the file into the ***nukkit/resource_packs/*** folder and restart the server.

#### [Geyser](https://discord.com/invite/geysermc):
- Simply move the file into the ***geyser-spigot/packs/*** folder and restart the server.

#### [Dragonfly](https://discord.gg/NRbJ9Q8zmn): 
- Simply move the file into the ***dragonfly/resources/*** folder and restart the server.

#### [WaterDog](enable_packs):
- Enable ```"enable_packs" ``` in ```config.yml```. Simply move the file into the ***waterdog/packs/*** folder and restart the server.

**Step 3.** Create a Pull Request

Add your server to the `serverlist.json` file at the bottom by making a pull request. Use this template:

```json
  {
    "displayName": "SERVERNAME",
    "packName": "bedrockconnect",
    "ip": "SERVER IP",
    "port": 19132,
    "featured": false,
    "partner": false
  }
```

Please note:

- Do not change the UUID, version, engine version, or format version.
- Don't modify the pack's contents; keep it empty.

Lastly, if you're unsure how to make a pull request, refer to this [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

# How does it work?

The [<strong>Serverpack.zip</strong>](https://pack.bedrockhub.io/bedrockconnect) file simplifies the process of managing server packs by ensuring every server has the same pack. Console players benefit from the custom texture packs, and there's no need for constant updates. It's a win-win for everyone!
